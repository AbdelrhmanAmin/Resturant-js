      <h1>Vegan Resturant</h1>
      <p>
        Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high
        standard. Definitely fine dining. It can be expensive but worth it and
        they do different deals on different nights so itâ€™s worth checking them
        out before you book. Highly recommended.
